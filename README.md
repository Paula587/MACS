**MACS201 Hilbert spaces, mathematical statistics and Probability**

This course deals with the foundations probability theory : general construction and calculus
rules for the conditional expectation, conditional distribution, stochastic processes and spectral
representations, stopping times and filtrations, dominated measures. These concepts are
introduced using the fundamental theorems of Hilbert analysis such as the projection theorem
and the representation theorem. With the necessary probabilistic tools at hand, we introduce the
major theorems of mathematical statistics. Finally, the last part of the course focus on the bases
of Markov chains theory in general state spaces (probability kernels, strong Markov property,
invariant measures).

**MACS203 Martingales and Asymptotic Statistics Part I**

We start by recalling the essential notions of convergence of random sequences and in
particular, weak convergence. Applications in asymptotic statistics are developed. The theory of
martingales, an essential tool in stochastic calculus, is also introduced with applications to
Markov chains.

**MACS205 Numerical analysis**

Numerical methods come into play in applied mathematics as soon as the numerical value for
some quantity of interest is needed, for which no analytic expression is available. This quantity
may be e.g. anintegral or the solution of a differential equation.
The scope of application of this course thus embraces such diverse fields as Physics, Biology,
Economy or Finance. The role played by numerical analysis has substantially grown these past few years, together with extensive computing power.
Numerical methods may be divided into two broad classes: deterministic methods on the one
hand, based on discrete approximations of integrals or state evolution equations, and stochastic
methods on the other hand, which consist in random sampling under an appropriate probability
distribution in order to approximate an integral or a
trajectory. This may be done by independent sampling (Monte-Carlo methods) or by simulating a
well chosen Markov Chain (MCMC methods).
The purpose of this course is to introduce the students to essential methods in Numerical
Analysis and to give them the key tools for understanding the mathematical principles behind.

**MACS207a Stochastic calculus**

Itô calculus extends to the stochastic world the well known tools of deterministic calculus. It has
far reaching applications mmost notably to mathematical finance.
- The student will be able to apply the Itô formula and use its various consequences
- The student will understand the Black & Scholes model and its limitations

**MACS207b Continuous time Markov chains and martingales**

Continuous Time Markov Chains are at the core of any stochastic models. This course is
devoted to the mathematical basis for the analysis of these processes.
- Use Continuous Time Markov Chains to model physical phenomena, protocols, spread of
disease, etc.
- Simulate these processes
- Analyse the transient dynamics of these processes by martingales
- Identify the possible limiting processes
